# ComputationalFinance
Here are some quantitative/computational finance projects.

# MonteCarlo_Pricing.py:
Applied Monte Carlo method to price Vanilla Options, and implemented antithetic sampling to reduce variance.
# European_Binomial.py:
Pricing the Options by generating binomial stock tree.
# Project1:
Applied the Black-Scholes formula to get Options Prices. Finding implied Vol in the Black-Scholes approach both using the Newton and Bisect methods.
# Project2:
Implemented Monte Carlo approach to generate stock path and got Options price, which was similar with MonteCarlo_Pricing.py. While the MonteCarlo_Pricing.py used the structure class to accompanish, Project2 did it by some simple functions.
